# When you hear the word “Asylum,” what vivid images come to life in your mind?

Do you see a serene sanctuary, bathed in warm light, where those seeking safety can finally breathe, embraced by compassion and professional care? Or perhaps a haunting, gothic manor, its towering spires piercing the sky, guarded by iron gates that seem to whisper tales of sorrow— an institution that offers hope yet often falls tragically short in its promise to nurture the fragile souls within?

For me, the imagery is as striking as a thunderbolt illuminating the stormy skies over Arkham Asylum. Yes, you’ve guessed it—when I hear “Asylum,” I’m transported back to the 1990s, to the intoxicating world of the Batman animated series.

As a little girl, I donned a homemade cape, stitched together by my indomitable grandmother, a Holocaust survivor whose resilience pulsed through every thread. Each Purim, I transformed into Batman, embodying the hero who haunted my dreams.

The very mention of Arkham Asylum, for me, conjured a haunting comparison; those gates, emblazoned with the name “Arkham Asylum,” echo the chilling inscription “arbeit macht frei” from Auschwitz—a reminder of the nature of such places. Their promise of liberation is but a deadly joke.

  Thus, when I learned that the very word of Asylum as, rather than hopeless prison that masks itself as psychiatric guard, meant to convey a place of hope and shelter, I was confused. Arkham Asylum, with its haunting corridors, is not just a backdrop for the caped crusader's adventures; I realized it embodies a profound commentary on mental health, societal fears, and the stigmas that have persisted throughout American history. 
  
  This surprising duality lies at the heart of my exploration, beckoning me to delve deeper into its layers and intricacies. How does Arkham reflect the evolving understanding of mental illness? What cultural currents have molded it into something more than a mere institution for the mentally ill?  This intertwining of history, mental health, and popular culture paints a rich picture, one that I forever want to explore and reflect on how the characters we idolize—and those we vilify shaped by the very societal fears we struggle to confront. Join me as I take this journey to reveal not just the nature of the asylum, but also the dark corners of our collective psyche."

# From “Hospital for the Criminally Insane” to “Plot Device” – A Cultural History of Arkham Asylum

## The origins of Arkham Asylum in the Batman comics date back to 1974, when it was first introduced as a hospital. However, a revealing caption makes it clear: it is merely “a polite name for an asylum which houses the criminally insane.” This unsettling duality sets the stage for a gripping  narrative filled with tension and intrigue.[^note1]

  image-path="scrollstory/images/for my project/1974 batman 258 cover.png"

### The story kicks off dramatically with the shocking escape of Two-Face, also known as Harvey Dent, from Arkham Hospital. The very cover-page captures the reader's attention, describing Two-Face as “the crook who bases his crimes on the number two! He was on the side of the law until a criminal scarred half his face with acid! Now he’s a mixture of good and evil!”[^note2]

[^note2]: O'neil, *Batman* #258, 1.

As the plot thickens, our heroes, Batman and Robin, spring into action, racing against time to recapture Two-Face. His escape from Arkham was orchestrated by a renegade military general named John Harris, who believes “the nation is going to the dogs!” Disillusioned with the current state of affairs, Harris devises a chaotic scheme to hold Washington D.C. ransom using an atomic bomb, enlisting the twisted talents of Two-Face in his perilous plot.

As with every Batman comic from that time, the story ends with the successful detention of Two-Face by Batman, with your usual shenanigans of ”POW!,” “Bam!” and “KA-PAW!”

So, what was really going on during this time that might have bled into the most escapist form of reading, found in Batman’s comic book adventures?

Layered within this debut issue of Arkham is the context of the Cold War, a period significantly shaped by the aftermath of World War II and the lasting impact of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following these events, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers. However, rather than uniting the world, they fostered a fierce rivalry that defined the era. This conflict took on an ideological dimension, pitting American capitalism and free markets against Soviet communism. Although direct military confrontations between the two superpowers were rare and the conflict primarily manifested in technological advancements and competition for influence in countries around the globe, the constant threat of nuclear escalation cast a dark shadow over society and fueled widespread national paranoia throughout the duration of the Cold War.[^notex]

[^notex]:Odd Arne Westad, *The Global Cold War: Third World Interventions and the Making of Our Times* (Cambridge University Press, 2005) pp. 2-4.

Indeed, in this specific comic book, there are several panels that include explanations on how nuclear bomb works and mentions of Hiroshima:

  image-path="scrollstory\images\for my project\1974 batman 258 p9 atomic bomb explanation.png"
%}

What probably triggered this nuclear panic we are witnessing in this comic was the collapse of the so-called “détente”—a fancy French word for "let's not blow each other up," crafted in the early '70s by Nixon and Kissinger. They thought they could keep the nuclear arms race from becoming a full-blown game of nuclear chicken, especially when the Soviet Union caught up with the U.S. in the atomic arms department. However, after Watergate and Nixon's resignation in 1974, the détente started to crack and the threat of nuclear escalation was back to haunt the people.[^notew]

In the popular imagination of this era, the concept of "villains" turned into a real blockbuster of paranoia. No longer just the menacing foes lurking beyond the borders with their nuclear arsenal, but also "traitors from within"—such as double agents and Soviet sympathizers.[^note0] Although this Batman comic does not mention Soviet influence, it offers a two-for-one deal on villainy: a nuclear threat paired with ordinary traitors. Yes, in plural, as not only General Harris is in on the scheme but also a side character that appears on only few panels:

## Samuel Smith-Smythe, a former member of the Atomic Energy Commission. 
Disillusioned by the government’s meager salaries, forsakes his position for the allure of private enterprise, chasing after greater profits.Joining forces with the rogue General Harris, Smythe grants him access to nuclear bombs and spring Two-Face to extort the very government that once employed them both. Coming out on the heels of the Watergate scandal, we can also understand why this is the story the comic chose to tell us. The same summer America learned that the highest officials in the land—White House aides, FBI, CIA, even the President’s personal lawyer—could betray everything for loyalty, power, or a better deal. No Kremlin required. In 1974 the scariest enemy wasn’t wearing a hammer-and-sickle pin; he was wearing the same suit and tie as the American people trusted with the ultimate weapons. 

Turns out that plot twists weren't just the realm of DC Comics—politicians were crafting their own high-stakes dramas too. Take Senator Joseph McCarthy, for instance. In the early years of the Cold War, he spearheaded a gripping "witch hunt" that could give Batman's rogues gallery a run for their money. His mission? To sniff out alleged communist subversives like a bloodhound on a scent trail, all while leaving behind a legacy that would haunt the nation long after the 1950s faded into history. “Communist subversives” ended up being a catch-all label that included a unique group: homosexuals. Back then, they were not just considered socially awkward but were actually classified as having a mental disease and as a threat to the national security.[^note3]

This climate bled also into popular culture, and, in our case, superhero comics.

The iconic superhero figures such as Batman and Superman emerged in the United States during the late 1930s, embodying the ideals of strength and power characteristic of the American Dream. During this formative era, which lasted till the early 1950s, there was a notable proliferation of superhero narratives and an unprecedented flourishing of comic book publications. If you want to sound like an expert, all you should say is "The Golden Age of Comics," a term that defines these "simpler" times, just before the Cold War made everything more complicated.

During that same time, concerns about rising youth crime led many people to blame comic books for this problem. As a result, the superhero comic industry faced a decline and came under intense scrutiny. Frederick Wertham, a German-American psychiatrist, published a book in 1954 called Seduction of the Innocent. In it, he argued that comic books were promoting violent behavior and encouraging unhealthy sexual attitudes among young people. [^note4]

[^note4]: Ann Annessa Babic, *Comics as History, Comics as Literature: Roles of the Comic Book in Scholarship, Society, and Entertainment*, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2014, 135-137.

  caption="The offending panel Wertham talks about, from “Ten Nights of Fear!” *Batman* #84, 1954, p.1."
  image-path="scrollstory\images\for my project\batmanrobin.png"

In particular, Wertham refers to Batman and Robin relationship, targeting a specific panel from 1954 issue of Batman (on the left) and writes: “The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious.” For Wertham, the sexual connotations of the comic were obvious: “Only someone ignorant of the fundamentals of psychiatry and of the psychopathology of sex can fail to realize a subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature ‘Batman’ and his young friend ‘Robin.’”[^note5]

[^note5]: Fredric Wertham, *Seduction of the Innocent* (Rinehart: 1954) pp. 189-190.

This book played a significant role in the criticism of comics during that time, so much that in response to the raising accusations, and in a self-censoring move, the comic books industry established its own code of conduct, that was then updated every decade.[^note6]

[^note6]: The 1948 code mirrored the sentiments of McCarthyism and nascent Cold War ideologies, while the 1954 version followed suit and started officially what is known as "The Silver Age of Comics,” in which DC avoided political topics and violence.  The code was updated every decade to reflect and respond to changes in society, and the one from the 1970s specifically took notice of the civil rights initiatives of the time, see: Chris York and Rafiel York, *Comic Books and the Cold War, 1946-1962: Essays on Graphic Treatment of Communism, the Code and Social Concerns* (McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers: 2012), p. 5, 70; Babic, *Comics as History*, p.7. 

The fact that Wertham chose to speak out against comics, leveraging his authority as a psychiatrist (notice the "MD" by his name in a book about popular culture?) should also tell us something about the significant changes in public attitudes toward the mental health field that was taking place during the 1940s and 1950s.
