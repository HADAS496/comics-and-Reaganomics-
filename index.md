# When you hear the word “Asylum,” what vivid images come to life in your mind?

Do you see a serene sanctuary, bathed in warm light, where those seeking safety can finally breathe, embraced by compassion and professional care? Or perhaps a haunting, gothic manor, its towering spires piercing the sky, guarded by iron gates that seem to whisper tales of sorrow— an institution that offers hope yet often falls tragically short in its promise to nurture the fragile souls within?

For me, the imagery is as striking as a thunderbolt illuminating the stormy skies over Arkham Asylum. Yes, you’ve guessed it—when I hear “Asylum,” I’m transported back to the 1990s, to the intoxicating world of the Batman animated series.

## As a little girl, I donned a homemade cape, stitched together by my indomitable grandmother, a Holocaust survivor whose resilience pulsed through every thread. Each Purim, I transformed into Batman, embodying the hero who haunted my dreams.

The very mention of Arkham Asylum, for me, conjured a haunting comparison; those gates, emblazoned with the name “Arkham Asylum,” echo the chilling inscription “arbeit macht frei” from Auschwitz—a reminder of the nature of such places. Their promise of liberation is but a deadly joke.

  Thus, when I learned that the very word of Asylum as, rather than hopeless prison that masks itself as psychiatric guard, meant to convey a place of hope and shelter, I was confused. Arkham Asylum, with its haunting corridors, is not just a backdrop for the caped crusader's adventures; I realized it embodies a profound commentary on mental health, societal fears, and the stigmas that have persisted throughout American history. 
  
  This surprising duality lies at the heart of my exploration, beckoning me to delve deeper into its layers and intricacies. How does Arkham reflect the evolving understanding of mental illness? What cultural currents have molded it into something more than a mere institution for the mentally ill?  This intertwining of history, mental health, and popular culture paints a rich picture, one that I forever want to explore and reflect on how the characters we idolize—and those we vilify shaped by the very societal fears we struggle to confront. Join me as I take this journey to reveal not just the nature of the asylum, but also the dark corners of our collective psyche."

# From “Hospital for the Criminally Insane” to “Plot Device” – A Cultural History of Arkham Asylum

### The origins of Arkham Asylum in the Batman comics date back to 1974, when it was first introduced as a hospital. However, a revealing caption makes it clear: it is merely “a polite name for an asylum which houses the criminally insane.” This unsettling duality sets the stage for a gripping  narrative filled with tension and intrigue.[^note1]

  image-path="scrollstory/images/for my project/1974 batman 258 cover.png"

### The story kicks off dramatically with the shocking escape of Two-Face, also known as Harvey Dent, from Arkham Hospital. The very cover-page captures the reader's attention, describing Two-Face as “the crook who bases his crimes on the number two! He was on the side of the law until a criminal scarred half his face with acid! Now he’s a mixture of good and evil!”[^note2]

[^note2]: O'neil, *Batman* #258, 1974, p.1.

As the plot thickens, our heroes, Batman and Robin, spring into action, racing against time to recapture Two-Face. His escape from Arkham was orchestrated by a renegade military general named John Harris, who believes “the nation is going to the dogs!” Disillusioned with the current state of affairs, Harris devises a chaotic scheme to hold Washington D.C. ransom using an atomic bomb, enlisting the twisted talents of Two-Face in his perilous plot.

As with every Batman comic from that time, the story ends with the successful detention of Two-Face by Batman, with your usual shenanigans of ”POW!,” “Bam!” and “KA-PAW!”

So, what was really going on during this time that might have bled into the most escapist form of reading, found in Batman’s comic book adventures?

Layered within this debut issue of Arkham is the context of the Cold War, a period significantly shaped by the aftermath of World War II and the lasting impact of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following these events, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers. However, rather than uniting the world, they fostered a fierce rivalry that defined the era. This conflict took on an ideological dimension, pitting American capitalism and free markets against Soviet communism. Although direct military confrontations between the two superpowers were rare and the conflict primarily manifested in technological advancements and competition for influence in countries around the globe, the constant threat of nuclear escalation cast a dark shadow over society and fueled widespread national paranoia throughout the duration of the Cold War.[^notex]

Indeed, in this specific comic book, there are several panels that include explanations on how nuclear bomb works and mentions of Hiroshima.

What probably triggered this nuclear panic we are witnessing in this comic was the collapse of the so-called “détente”—a fancy French word for "let's not blow each other up," crafted in the early '70s by Nixon and Kissinger. They thought they could keep the nuclear arms race from becoming a full-blown game of nuclear chicken, especially when the Soviet Union caught up with the U.S. in the atomic arms department. However, after Watergate and Nixon's resignation in 1974, the détente started to crack and the threat of nuclear escalation was back to haunt the people.[^notew]

In the popular imagination of this era, the concept of "villains" turned into a real blockbuster of paranoia. No longer just the menacing foes lurking beyond the borders with their nuclear arsenal, but also "traitors from within"—such as double agents and Soviet sympathizers.[^note0] Although this Batman comic does not mention Soviet influence, it offers a two-for-one deal on villainy: a nuclear threat paired with ordinary traitors. Yes, in plural, as not only General Harris is in on the scheme but also a side character that appears on only few panels.

## Enter Samuel Smith-Smythe, a former member of the Atomic Energy Commission. 
Disillusioned by the government’s meager salaries, forsakes his position for the allure of private enterprise, chasing after greater profits.Joining forces with the rogue General Harris, Smythe grants him access to nuclear bombs and spring Two-Face to extort the very government that once employed them both. Coming out on the heels of the Watergate scandal, we can also understand why this is the story the comic chose to tell us. The same summer America learned that the highest officials in the land—White House aides, FBI, CIA, even the President’s personal lawyer—could betray everything for loyalty, power, or a better deal. No Kremlin required. In 1974 the scariest enemy wasn’t wearing a hammer-and-sickle pin; he was wearing the same suit and tie as the American people trusted with the ultimate weapons.

### Turns out that plot twists weren't just the realm of DC Comics—politicians were crafting their own high-stakes dramas too.
 Take Senator Joseph McCarthy, for instance. In the early years of the Cold War, he spearheaded a gripping "witch hunt" that could give Batman's rogues gallery a run for their money. His mission? To sniff out alleged communist subversives like a bloodhound on a scent trail, all while leaving behind a legacy that would haunt the nation long after the 1950s faded into history. “Communist subversives” ended up being a catch-all label that included a unique group: homosexuals. 
 Back then, they were not just considered socially awkward but were actually classified as having a mental disease and as a threat to the national security.[^note3]

The iconic superhero figures such as Batman and Superman emerged in the United States during the late 1930s, embodying the ideals of strength and power characteristic of the American Dream. During this formative era, which lasted till the early 1950s, there was a notable proliferation of superhero narratives and an unprecedented flourishing of comic book publications. If you want to sound like an expert, all you should say is "The Golden Age of Comics," a term that defines these "simpler" times, just before the Cold War made everything more complicated.

### During that same time, concerns about rising youth crime led many people to blame comic books for this problem. As a result, the superhero comic industry faced a decline and came under intense scrutiny. Frederick Wertham, a German-American psychiatrist, published a book in 1954 called Seduction of the Innocent. In it, he argued that comic books were promoting violent behavior and encouraging unhealthy sexual attitudes among young people. [^note4]

[^note4]: Ann Annessa Babic, *Comics as History, Comics as Literature: Roles of the Comic Book in Scholarship, Society, and Entertainment*, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2014, 135-137.

  caption="The offending panel Wertham talks about from *Batman* #84, 1954, p.1."
  image-path="scrollstory\images\for my project\batmanrobin.png"
%}

In particular, Wertham refers to Batman and Robin relationship, targeting a specific panel from 1954 issue of Batman (on the left) and writes: “The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious.” For Wertham, the sexual connotations of the comic were obvious: “Only someone ignorant of the fundamentals of psychiatry and of the psychopathology of sex can fail to realize a subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature ‘Batman’ and his young friend ‘Robin.’”[^note5] 

[^note5]: Fredric Wertham, *Seduction of the Innocent* (Rinehart: 1954) pp. 189-190.

This book played a significant role in the criticism of comics during that time, so much that in response to the raising accusations, and in a self-censoring move, the comic books industry established its own code of conduct, that was then updated every decade.[^note6] 

[^note6]: The 1948 code mirrored the sentiments of McCarthyism and nascent Cold War ideologies, while the 1954 version followed suit and started officially what is known as "The Silver Age of Comics,” in which DC avoided political topics and violence.  The code was updated every decade to reflect and respond to changes in society, and the one from the 1970s specifically took notice of the civil rights initiatives of the time, see: Chris York and Rafiel York, *Comic Books and the Cold War, 1946-1962: Essays on Graphic Treatment of Communism, the Code and Social Concerns* (McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers: 2012), p. 5, 70; Babic, *Comics as History*, p.7. 

### The fact that Wertham chose to speak out against comics, leveraging his authority as a psychiatrist (notice the "MD" by his name in a book about popular culture?) should also tell us something about the significant changes in public attitudes toward the mental health field that was taking place during the 1940s and 1950s. 

In 1946, Albert Q. Maisel, a writer for Life magazine, published a groundbreaking exposé that revealed the deplorable conditions in state mental hospitals and asylums. His investigation ignited a nationwide conversation about the treatment of individuals with mental illnesses during that era.

The above picture to the right, taken from Maisel's article, shows a visibly emaciated woman, abandoned and left to suffer, her frail figure and distended abdomen embodying the despair that many experience daily. One of the most harrowing revelations in Maisel’s article is his stark comparison of U.S. mental health institutions to Nazi concentration camps. Next to it, I've compiled two pictures from the liberation of Auschwitz that circulated ever since 1945. By evoking these pictures and connections, Maisel powerfully argued that “through public and legislative penny-pinching, state after state has allowed its institutions for the care and cure of the mentally ill to degenerate into little more than concentration camps on the Belsen pattern.” [^note234] 

[^note234]: Albert Q. Maisel, “Bedlam 1946 Most U.S. Mental Hospital Are a Shame and a Disgrace,” *Life*, May 6, 1946, p.118.

- 
It seems clear now why the thoughts of Arkham Asylum and Auschwitz are not merely provocative—they are essential for understanding the broader implications of how American society thought about these institutions.

Maisel was not alone in his criticism. In 1948 the film *the snake pit* came out and told the real-life story of Mary Jane Ward as an institutionalized patient from 1931 to 1937. The movie showed the viewers all kinds of experimental somatic treatments: insulin coma therapy, Metrazol shock, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), hydrotherapy—and how it was applied on mass scale without the patients’ informed consent and sometimes with little understanding of why (or whether) they worked. [^note252] The film garnered critical acclaim and increased public awareness and outcry against state mental hospitals and asylums. Civil rights movements started emerging, fighting to ensure that individuals with severe mental illness had the right to be treated in the least restrictive environments available.

## 1954 was a big one. Not only Wertham published his book in  which he condemns comic genre to hell, but also the introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) which was the first effective antipsychotic, prompted the American Psychiatric Association and other organizations to advocate for federal legislation that would facilitate higher rates of discharge from custodial settings.[^note152]

  Louis Henry Ross has committed series of robberies during the year of 1920, and his victims often reported of his hysterical laughter while doing so, thus leading to his unique nickname by the press. Upon being caught in 1921, he was to receive a six to ten year prison term. However, following a mental breakdown during his first two years in prison, the judge declared him insane and put him in Farview, a rather new state hospital in the American landscape at Pennsylvania which opened its doors in 1912 and was dedicated for the criminally insane. Ross had lived in this institution, never receiving any therapy of any kind. Even when he did improved on his own and seemed, by the attendants as “pleasant, coherent and relevant” and “normal in every respect,” his release was never recommended and even his pleas for examination or parole hearings were denied.In 1954 he tried to escape and manage to get to attorney office and arranged for a lawsuit. The judge ordered his immediate release, saying that Farview “would necessarily condemn a patient for life with no hope of returning to society.” Upon his release in December 9th, headlines exploded, announcing the release of perfectly sane person from unjust state mental facility after being trapped there for over 20 years.[^noteM]

After Wertham’s book and the establishment of the Comics Code Authority in 1954, editors of Batman comic books adhered to the principles of banning gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies. Joker, in fact,  almost completely disappeared from the landscape of Batman comic books during the 1960s, when an editor who disliked the Joker became the main editor of the comic series. The campy 1966 Batman tv series featured Joker in his most clownly goofiness, complete with acid squirting flowers, trick guns and lethal joy buzzers.[^note292]

During that same time federal legislation started to take root. The 1963 Community Mental Health Act funded community-based centers offering inpatient/outpatient care, partial hospitalization, emergency services, and education. [^note312] Next followed the Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, which shifted institutional funding from states to the federal government, encouraging reduced reliance on large psychiatric hospitals.[^note316]

 The 1966 Lake v. Cameron ruling established the “least restrictive setting” principle, requiring discharge to less restrictive environments when possible. Combined with stricter admission criteria, these changes made hospitalization much harder to access. As a result, many individuals with severe mental illness were discharged without adequate community support, leading to widespread homelessness, arrests, and premature deaths. Psychiatrist Darold Treffert’s 1973 phrase “dying with one’s rights on” criticized laws that prioritized civil liberties over safety and treatment needs. This trend culminated in the 1975 Supreme Court case O’Connor v. Donaldson, which ruled that nondangerous individuals capable of surviving safely outside (alone or with help) could not be confined against their will. [^note326]

 So, we’ve just done with  this historical crazy train called deinstitutionalization (and good luck saying it without your tongue taking a vacation!) —which is just a fancy term for the shift from state mental hospitals and asylums to community mental health centers. 
 
## This brings us full circle to where we started: the first Batman’s iconic 1974 issue that introduced Arkham Hospital for the criminally insane. 
In particular, this is also the moment when  General Harris breaks free Two-Face and they both leave behind a very angry Joker.

## DC Comics made a very bold move. After almost two decades when Joker almost disappeared and was more of a goofy harmless prankster  rather than a serious criminal and threat to Batman-  the comic company decided on launching a dedicated series all for him.

The series debuted right on the heels of General Harris's dramatic escape with Two-Face, leaving the Joker behind in a fit of fury and revenge. This pivotal moment marked not only a significant turning point in the Joker's storyline but also an intriguing connection to Arkham Asylum. While Batman #258 initially associated Two-Face with Arkham Hospital, the first issue of the Joker series boldly announced, “You’ve just entered the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane - in the midst of an escape! Therefore… You’re in on the beginning of one of the strangest episodes in the annals of crime! Look… Listen…”[^note367]

DC Comics kept using Arkham as hospital in some comics and asylum at others, sometime in the very same comic. In Joker #2, for example, the captions announced “Arkham asylum for the criminally insane” but the signage in the panel’s drawing says “Arkham Hospital.” After yet again another escape of Joker, the superintendent of the Asylum shouts at the staff: “How could you be fooled by that? This is the FIFTH TIME you’ve let THE JOKER escape! Well, there won’t be a sixth!” [^note369]

As we can see, while the 1970s Batman's tales often kick off with the release of patients from Arkham Hospital/Asylum, these rarely reflect the reality of effective treatment, such as the use of antipsychotic medications, or the legal reforms aimed at preventing the indefinite confinement of mentally ill individuals. The inability to confine dangerous “insane” criminals keeps resurfacing in these comics as a looming threat to society 

It took until 1980 for Arkham to officially become Arkham Asylum, rather than being referred to as "Arkham Hospital" throughout the 1970s, but the core-narrative never changes: no one gets out of Arkham because of a successful treatment, psychosurgery or antipsychotic drugs, and followed with rehabilitation back to society; and neither do the new, civil-rights informed laws that forbid involuntary confinement of mentally ill people show up in these comics. 
This stagnant portrayal begs the question: 

### What is the relation between real-life mental health practices of the 1970s and the depicting of the treatment of the criminally insane in Batman’s fictional context? Why does Arkham continue to evoke a haunting image of “criminally insane” patients trapped in a labyrinth of custodial settings, when in reality, American society was very much informed by court cases and laws that forbid involuntary confinement?

Already in *Batman* #260 (February 1975), when Batman is fighting Joker in Arkham Hospital after yet another take-over of the inmates, Joker is portrayed thinking: “How delightful, whatever happens to the Batman, the law can’t hold these homicidal maniacs responsible!” [^note441]

This is a critical commentary during a time when the notion of “danger to himself or others” was ruled in the high court. These same notions of the Joker keeps surfacing, as in the *Joker* #4, when he proudly tells his kidnappee:

In these examples, the Joker discusses his rights as a mental patient and his accountability for his actions, reflecting the legal discussions of his time on mental health and the criminal system. This brings us to the murky waters of criminality, mental health, and the justice system.

The social welfare state of 1960s used to assist and care for individuals with substance abuse issues, sex offenders, people with disabilities and undocumented immigrants. However, when President Nixon took over office in 1969 there was a significant shift in how society addressed issues like drug use, crime, and poverty. Policymakers moved away from rehabilitative approaches and leaned toward tougher methods, such as increased surveillance, harsher punishments, coercive tactics, and even quarantine. As state asylums and mental hospitals closed, a new type of institutionalization emerged in the criminal justice system. When severe mentally ill patients couldn’t access community mental health centers, or get real treatment, they often time ended in the streets, which, in turn, led to them disturbing the public order and landing in jail. The criminal justice system, thus, took over the care of these individuals and focused less on diagnosing mental health issues and more on punishing law-breaking behavior. Ironically, since there was so much public discourse surrounding the civil rights of mentally ill people, police officers who arrested mentally ill people for nonserious offenses could not civilly commit them, so they opted for sending them to jail. [^note481] 

[^note481]: Parsons, *From Asylum to Prison*, pp. 6, 99, 106.

Not only were there movements for civil rights, but also movements for the rights of prisoners which sought to pass bills and statues such as “The Good Time Bill” which aimed to diminish the abolish minimum sentences for most male prisoners. Even just thinking about the name, we can clearly see how such attempted policies were portrayed in Batman comics:  not a real chance of rehabilitation, but rather a “good time,” a real “home” which criminally insane people like the Joke can utilize to their advantage, not only to escape, but to turn to. In that same year, there was also a major event of riot in Attica’s prison, as the inmates took control of the facility. However, instead of demanding their release, they called instead for more rights and basic humanitarian conditions. An army of armed forces swapped the facility, ending up killing 41 inmates and guards. The mainstream media chose to tell a very different story, of which the prisoners had slit hostages’ throats to get their demands met before state troopers invaded. The whole event had led to increasing call for punitive rather than rehabilitative prisons. [^note485]

And so it was that in 1971 not only the Good Time Bill was rejected, but a whole shift in mental health commitment laws started taking place, along with the public’s complete loss of faith in the welfare government programs in mental health and in prison system to rehabilitate individuals. [^note498] And if that wasn’t enough, the insanity defense also went through some major changes. The very same year of The Joker comic series launched, the Michigan Code of Criminal Procedure shifted from a verdict of criminal defendant as “not guilty by reason of insanity” to “guilty but mentally ill” which still allowed the court to sentence them to prison rather than a mental hospital.[^note500] It’s been a long coming now, that the insanity defense was under great deal of legal debate and criticism, including calls for its abolition. Thus came the “guilty but mentally ill” to act as an alternative to an insanity acquittal: its incarceration component addressed public concerns about crime and safety and allayed uncertainty about the accuracy of psychiatric prediction, efficacy of treatment, and premature release into the general population. While it came under constitutional attack on the grounds of “the right to treatment”  and “equal protection,” other states courts soon followed and embraced its approach. [note496]

This what leads some to argue that deinstitutionalization was more of trans-institutionalization, as it didn’t truly eliminate confinement but rather transformed it—making it so that individuals with severe mental illness transitioned from mental hospitals into prisons, with occasional stop at the streets. Batman’s comics reflect some vital questions about how society treats those with mental health issues and the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.
