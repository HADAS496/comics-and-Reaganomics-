# From “Hospital for the Criminally Insane” to “Plot Device” – A Cultural History of Arkham Asylum

The origins of Arkham Asylum in the Batman comics date back to 1974, where it was first introduced as a hospital. However, a revealing caption makes it clear: it is merely “a polite name for an asylum which houses the criminally insane.”[^note1]

 This unsettling duality sets the stage for a gripping narrative filled with tension and intrigue.
The story kicks off dramatically with the shocking escape of Two-Face, also known as Harvey Dent, from Arkham Hospital. The very cover-page captures the reader's attention, describing Two-Face as “the crook who bases his crimes on the number two! He was on the side of the law until a criminal scarred half his face with acid! Now he’s a mixture of good and evil!”[^note2]

As the plot thickens, our heroes, Batman and Robin, spring into action, racing against time to recapture Two-Face. His escape from Arkham was orchestrated by a renegade military general named John Harris, who believes “the nation is going to the dogs!” Disillusioned with the current state of affairs, Harris devises a chaotic scheme to hold Washington D.C. ransom using an atomic bomb, enlisting the twisted talents of Two-Face in his perilous plot.

As with every Batman comic from that time, the story ends with the successful detention of Two-Face by Batman, with your usual shenanigans of “Bam!” and “KA-PAW!”
 
So, what was really going on during this time that might have bled into the most escapist form of reading, found in Batman’s comic book adventures?
Layered within this debut issue of Arkham is the context of the Cold War, a period profoundly shaped by the aftermath of World War II and the traumatic legacy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the wake of these events, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers, but rather than uniting the world, they fostered a fierce rivalry that would define an era. During the Cold War, while direct military confrontations between the two super-powers were rare, the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation cast a dark shadow over society, igniting a wave of national paranoia throughout the whole duration of the Cold War.

Indeed, in this specific comic book, there are tones of panels that include explanations on how nuclear bomb works and mentions of Hiroshima:

 
In the early years of the Cold War, the nation was gripped by fears, not only of nuclear missiles targeting its borders but also of threats lurking within its own society. There was a growing anxiety surrounding "traitors from within" — double agents and Soviet sympathizers who could easily masquerade as everyday Americans.[^note4]

This atmosphere of suspicion is vividly illustrated in this Batman comic, even as a side character appears on only few panels: Samuel Smith-Smythe, a former member of the Atomic Energy Commission. Disillusioned by the government’s meager salaries, forsakes his position for the allure of private enterprise, chasing after greater profits. Joining forces with the rogue General Harris, Smythe grants him access to nuclear bombs and spring the villain Two-Face to extort the very government that once employed them both. All in all, this narrative is steeped in a chilling atmosphere of Cold War paranoia of a society already teetering on the brink. 


Perhaps no historical figure from that time embodies this fear better than Senator Joseph McCarthy, who led a fierce "witch hunt" to root out alleged communist subversives in the country during the 1950s and had an enduring legacy that exceeded well beyond this decade. Soon, this heightened political environment also persecuted homosexuals, who during that time were classified as having psychiatric disorder and were perceived as a danger to state safety (Robert L. Ivie, “Cold War Motives and the Rhetorical Metaphor: A Framework of Criticism,” in Cold War Rhetoric: Strategy, Metaphor, and Ideology, ed. Martin J. Medhurst et al. (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1997), 75). 
This climate bled also into popular culture, and, in our case, superhero comics- 

The iconic superhero figures such as Batman and Superman emerged in the United States during the late 1930s and 1940s, embodying the ideals of strength and power characteristic of the American Dream. During this formative era, which spanned from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, there was a notable proliferation of superhero narratives and an unprecedented flourishing of comic book publications. Comics books collectors and fans named this era "The Golden Age of Comics," nostalgic for those "simpler" times, before the Cold War made everything more complicated.
